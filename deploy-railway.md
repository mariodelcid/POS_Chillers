## Deployment Steps

### 1. Commit Your Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add date filtering to sales reports"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Deploy to Railway
Railway will automatically detect your changes and deploy them. The deployment process includes:

- Building your Node.js application
- Running database migrations (if any)
- Starting the new server with date filtering capabilities

### 3. Verify Deployment
After deployment, you can test the new features:

1. **Open your Railway app URL**
2. **Navigate to the Sales page**
3. **Try the date filters**:
   - Use the date pickers to select a custom range
   - Click the preset buttons (Today, Yesterday, etc.)
   - Check that the data updates correctly

## API Usage Examples

## Troubleshooting

### If Date Filters Don't Work
